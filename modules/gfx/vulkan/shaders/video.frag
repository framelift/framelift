#version 450

// Samples the video (or subtitle-overlay) texture. Used by both draws — the renderer
// switches the bound texture + blend state, not the shader.
//
// No V flip here (unlike the GL renderer): frames are uploaded top-row-first into a
// top-origin Vulkan image and the framebuffer is Y-down, so row 0 already maps to the
// top of the screen.
