// The aggregate application settings. Dependency-free by design: it does NOT know
// the concrete per-module settings structs. Each section (AudioSettings,
// PlaybackSettings, …) is owned and defined by its module and stored type-erased
// here; consumers reach a section with the Get<T>() template after including that
// module's header. The former monolithic SETTINGS_FIELDS X-macro is gone — fields
// are declared via each module's RegisterXSettings() (see SettingsRegistry.h).
//
// Settings.cpp is the single place that includes every section header: its
// constructor registers each one, and BuildSettingsRegistry() binds their fields.
