// Deliberately free of any libav / platform-audio include so it can be unit-tested
// with the native compiler (tests/FFmpegClockTests.cpp) — the standalone CI test
// build has neither FFmpeg nor Qt Multimedia available. Everything here operates on plain seconds /
// bytes and is therefore trivially exercised in isolation.

// The audio clock is the master clock. We know the presentation timestamp of the
// last audio sample handed to the device (lastQueuedPts) and how many bytes are
// still sitting in the device's queue, not yet audible. Subtracting the duration
// of that backlog yields the timestamp of the audio currently being heard.
//
//   masterClock = lastQueuedPts - queuedBytes / bytesPerSec
//
// queuedBytes naturally stops draining while the device is paused, which freezes
// the returned clock for free. bytesPerSec <= 0 (device not open yet) falls back
// to lastQueuedPts so callers never divide by zero.
