// ListView whenever the list has keyboard focus, including its built-in,
// minimal scroll-to-current behaviour — so navigation never yanks an
// already-visible row. `active` is a convenience hook the panel binds to its
// open state; the panel's own onActiveChanged should call forceActiveFocus()
// (and seed currentIndex) so the arrows work immediately when it opens.
