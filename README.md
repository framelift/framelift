# FrameLift

An **extensible** Qt/QML video player built on Qt 6, FFmpeg, and libass — where user-facing
features are runtime-loaded plugins. The host application has no compile-time knowledge of any of
them: playback controls, playlists, history, settings, network streaming, and updates are all plugin
DLLs loaded at startup over a stable, versioned binary ABI; the window, decode/playback engine, and
platform integration are built-in modules compiled into the host. Add or remove plugin features by
dropping a DLL/SO in or out of the `plugins/` folder.

## Features

- **Plugin architecture** — user-facing features are separate DLLs loaded at runtime; build and ship your
  own against the dependency-free [Plugin SDK](#extending-framelift-plugin-sdk)
- **Vulkan-first rendering** — defaults to a Vulkan backend, automatically falling back to OpenGL
  on machines without a suitable Vulkan device
- **Zero-copy GPU decode** — on the Vulkan backend, supported codecs decode straight into GPU images
  the renderer samples directly (no CPU readback). Otherwise hardware decode via CUDA/NVDEC, D3D11VA
  (Windows), or VAAPI (Linux), with a software fallback last
- **Video & image playback** — MP4, MKV, AVI, MOV, WMV, FLV, WebM, M4V, MPG/MPEG, PNG, JPG, GIF, BMP,
  WebP, and anything FFmpeg supports
- **Network streaming** — play remote http/https/rtsp sources (and custom encrypted streams)
- **Playlist** — automatically populated from the opened file's directory, with optional recursive
  subdirectory scanning, shuffle, and auto-reload on directory changes
- **History with resume** — recently played files with saved positions, in a searchable side panel
- **Multi-track audio & subtitles** — switch tracks and adjust subtitle delay at runtime
- **Dynamic audio normalization** — optional dynaudnorm filter with tunable parameters
- **Image slideshow** — configurable auto-advance interval for image-only or mixed playlists
- **Fully rebindable hotkeys** — every action has a default keybind, all overridable in settings
- **Theming** — dark/light/classic presets, custom accent color, and font
- **Auto-update** — background update check against GitHub Releases, applied on next launch (Windows)
- **Debug & benchmark overlays** — live playback stats and performance benchmarking

## Installation

Download the latest release archive from the [Releases](../../releases) page, extract, and run
`FrameLift`. No installer needed — the archive is self-contained.

**Platforms:** Windows (x86_64) and Linux (X11/Wayland via Qt).

**Requirements:** a GPU supporting **Vulkan 1.1+** *or* **OpenGL 3.3** (FrameLift auto-selects Vulkan
and falls back to OpenGL when needed; zero-copy GPU decode additionally needs a Vulkan 1.3 video-decode
capable GPU). On Linux, install Qt 6, FFmpeg, and libass from your distribution (e.g. `qt6-base`,
`qt6-declarative`, `qt6-multimedia`, `libavcodec`, `libavformat`, `libavfilter`, `libass9`) plus a
Vulkan loader (`libvulkan1`).

## Configuration

Settings live in `settings.ini` in the platform config directory and are edited through the in-app
**Settings menu** (Ctrl+,) — no need to hand-edit the file. Among the things you can configure:

- **Rendering & decode** — graphics backend (Vulkan/OpenGL, applied on restart) and hardware decoding
- **Playback** — precise seeking, video-sync, automatic loading of matching subtitle/audio files
- **Playlist** — recursive subdirectory scanning and depth, mixed video/image playlists, slideshow
  duration, and directory auto-reload
- **History** — how many recently played entries to keep
- **Audio** — dynamic normalization parameters
- **Appearance** — theme preset, accent color, and UI font
- **Hotkeys** — every action is rebindable
- **File types** — the video and image extension lists are fully customizable

Each plugin persists its own settings in its own INI section. See the Settings menu for the complete,
current list of options.

## Extending FrameLift (Plugin SDK)

Each FrameLift plugin ships as exactly one runtime-loaded Qt plugin DLL/SO under the `plugins/` folder
next to the executable. A *plugin* (what you build with the SDK) is a single `.Plugin.json` that
returns one **module** (`IModule`) and declares the **features** it provides and requires. Its artifact
name is the lowercase plugin id (e.g. `framelift.playlist.so`), and it is enabled or disabled from the
Settings → Plugins page (persisted by plugin id in `plugins.ini`). You can build your own against the
**dependency-free plugin SDK** (`framelift-sdk-<ver>.zip`, published as a Release asset on every
version tag).

- **Stable binary boundary.** The host↔plugin boundary is a COM-like binary ABI: pure abstract
  interfaces and POD-only method signatures, fronted by a Qt plugin factory (`IPlugin` +
  `Q_PLUGIN_METADATA`). A plugin built with any compatible compiler loads regardless of how the host
  was built. The ABI is a single integer, `FRAMELIFT_ABI_VERSION`, matched exactly; new host
  capabilities arrive as new discoverable service interfaces (capability discovery), so they never
  bump it.
- **JSON-authored metadata.** Each plugin declares its id, version, `abi`, features, and dependencies
  in a single `[Plugin].Plugin.json`. CMake validates it and embeds the resulting metadata into the
  plugin's `Q_PLUGIN_METADATA`, which the host reads before any vtable is touched; runtime does not
  read JSON sidecars.
- **Small surface.** Plugins include only the umbrella headers `<framelift/core.h>`,
  `<framelift/services.h>`, and `<framelift/platform.h>` plus Qt/QML headers — never host internals.
- **Cross-plugin communication.** Plugins never link against each other; they interact through the
  module context via pub/sub events and capability services discovered with `ctx.GetService<T>()` —
  `IHistory`, the settings split (`ISettingsStore`/`ISettingsRegistry`), and platform interface
  families (`IMediaPlayback`/`IAudioControl`/…, `IAppWindow`/`IGraphicsSurface`/`IEventPump`, …).

See [sdk/](sdk/) for the API, and the [FrameLift-Examples](https://github.com/FrameLift/FrameLift-Examples)
repository for worked example plugins to copy from.

```

The host (`src/`) has no compile-time knowledge of specific plugins; every plugin is loaded at
runtime from a DLL/SO such as `plugins/framelift.playlist.so`, dependency-resolved and ABI-checked
before any module object is constructed. Each plugin is instantiated unless its id is disabled in
`plugins.ini` (one `framelift.playlist=enabled|disabled` row per plugin; absent ⇒ enabled).

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- CMake 4.2.0+
- C++23-capable compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- `glslang` on PATH (the `glslang-tools` package) — compiles the GLSL shaders to SPIR-V at build time.
  CMake fetches and builds glslang as a fallback only when it isn't found on PATH.
- `clang-format` on PATH (for the pre-commit hook)
- **Linux only:** development packages for Qt 6, FFmpeg, libass, Vulkan, and OpenGL
  (e.g. on Ubuntu 25.04+: `sudo apt install qt6-base-dev qt6-declarative-dev qml6-module-qtquick
  qml6-module-qtquick-controls qt6-multimedia-dev libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libavutil-dev
  libswscale-dev libswresample-dev libavfilter-dev libass-dev libvulkan-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
  glslang-tools pkg-config`).
- **Windows only:** [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io) (`VCPKG_ROOT` set) — Qt, FFmpeg, and libass are
  resolved from the manifest in `vcpkg.json`. Configure with the vcpkg preset (`CMakePresets.json`).

### Steps

```sh
git clone <repo-url>
cd FrameLift

# Activate formatting hook (one-time per clone)
git config core.hooksPath .github/hooks

# Configure and build
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build --config Debug
```

Output: `cmake-build-debug/framelift` (`.exe` on Windows). On Windows the required shared libraries
are copied next to the executable; on Linux Qt/FFmpeg/libass are resolved from the system. Plugin
DLLs/SOs are placed under `cmake-build-debug/plugins/` (`.dll` on Windows, `.so` on Linux).
The Vulkan backend links the official Vulkan loader when enabled; a Vulkan runtime
(`libvulkan.so.1` / `vulkan-1.dll`) is required for Vulkan-enabled builds.

#### Lean builds

Each built-in module exposes a `FRAMELIFT_MODULE_<NAME>` CMake option whose default is the module's
`.Module.json` `enabled` flag. Pass `-DFRAMELIFT_MODULE_<NAME>=OFF` to drop a module and its
dependencies from the build — for example, a Vulkan-free build that keeps only the OpenGL backend:

```sh
cmake -B build-lean -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DFRAMELIFT_MODULE_GRAPHICS_VULKAN=OFF
cmake --build build-lean
```

CMake prints the enabled/disabled module table at configure time. Modules unsupported on the current
platform, or marked `required`, cannot be toggled this way.

### Dependencies

Native media libraries come from vcpkg (Windows) or the system (Linux); everything else is fetched by
CMake via `FetchContent`.
