// Plugin ABI version — a single integer
//
// FrameLift ships the host and every plugin from one source tree, in lockstep, so
// the ABI gate only needs to catch a stale binary accidentally left behind. The
// host loads a plugin iff:
//     plugin.abiVersion == host.abiVersion
// The check runs before any vtable is touched.
//
// Bump the version ONLY on a break to the core load-bearing handshake (Tier 1):
//   - the IPackage interface signature or its Q_PLUGIN_METADATA IID,
//   - the embedded package-metadata JSON shape the host parses (abi/packageId/
//     modules/…),
//   - a host-CALLED interface (IModule, IRenderable),
//   - the bootstrap surface of IModuleContext (GetServiceRaw/RegisterServiceRaw/
//     SubscribeRaw/PublishRaw).
//
// Everything else is a capability surface (Tier 2): host functionality is exposed
// as small, independently-discovered service interfaces. Adding, changing, or
// removing a Tier-2 interface NEVER bumps the version — consumers discover it with
// ctx.GetService<T>() and degrade when it returns nullptr.

// Load-time compatibility predicate. Header-only so both the host loader and the

// plugins are built together, so any mismatch means a stale binary that must be
